The mean is a measure of central tendency&mdash;something like the \"characteristic value of a distribution\", which the mean, median and mode all get at. **\"Mean\" is simply the formal term for the arithmetic average.** We'll focus on the simple case where possible outcomes are discrete, meaning that they are finite in number or **countably** infinite; most real-world data-sets involve discrete outcomes (but sometimes it is theoretically important to consider infinite outcomes; more on this later). \n",

    "    we write the mean as an expectation&mdash;we are **not** summing over any observed individuals. \n",
    "    Many textbooks and internet sources do not change their notation here, which confuses new students, so I \n",

    "    outcome $y_o$ by its probability of occurring, $\\mathbb{P}(Y=y_o)$. \n",

    "    The exception for our notation is that I will consistently use $\\widehat{\\mu}_Y$ to indicate the sample \n",
    "    estimate of the population mean. Most textbooks use the notation $\\bar{y}$. The problem with this notation \n",
    "    is that it breaks the general rule about Greek and Roman letters mentioned above and requires you to \n",

    "3. The variance is a measure of spread or dispersion. You can think about it as the expected difference between a randomly-selected observation and the mean. We define it formally as the expectation of the difference between the random variable *Y* and its mean $\\mu_Y: \\mathbb{V}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[(Y - \\mu)^2]$. You may wonder why we square the difference. There is a very good reason for this that leads us to the proof of a useful fact about the mean, which is that it is the value for a given set about which all deviations are not just minimized but also zero!\n",

    "Suppose that we are interested in determining whether two groups differ on some key outcome variable, such as their level of education or income. Let's be clear and formalistic about what we are after: we want to know whether or not, say, $\\mu_{income | white}  = \\mu_{income | black}$ or $\\mu_{education | male}  = \\mu_{education | female}$, where, to avoid the confusion caused by double subscripts, I've used the standard notation of a vertical bar to indicate \"given that one is...\". \n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious move here is just to replace these with their sample equivalents. So, using the older (if more confusing) notation for a sample mean, we might check whether $\\overline{educ}_{male} = \\overline{educ}_{female}$. And, in fact, this is exactly the right idea. The question now, however, is whether or not this difference is liable to have arisen by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should stop and really consider this for a moment because this is the entire idea behind *inferential* statistics, as opposed to simply descriptive statistics (recall: descriptive statistics are just ways of summarizing the data we have, whether these are population-level or sample-level, without reference to whether these represent some other group). Why can't I trust, say, an observed difference of a year between a group of men and women? \n",
    "\n",
    "One intuitive reason not to trust this, and this is what you'll almost always hear in internet arguments about this sort of thing from people who are a little learnèd (if not too learnèd), is that the sample size might be too small. It turns out that this is a little too conservative: we need to *adjust* for small sample sizes, but if we have a truly random sample, any data are better than no data, and we can just adjust for the small sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason not to trust this is that we don't have access to the whole population. This is really just the same objection as above: the sample size is too small. But, there's a subtle difference here: in this case, the gripe cuts to the heart of the matter. We don't just have a \"small\" sample size, whatever that might mean. We have a *sample*, period: some group of people smaller than the population we care about. And samples are noisy processes; that's what makes them great, in fact&mdash;they differ from the population only by random error (\"noise\"). But, we do need to take account of the error. So, how do we do that? \n",

    "## The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a judgment call about whether or not a sample mean $\\overline{Y}$ represents a population mean $\\mu_Y$, we need to have some sense for how the sample mean behaves across many samples. In other words, we need to know the probability distribution (technically: the probability density function, or PDF) of sample means. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Histograms and probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "I will presume here that you are at least loosely familiar generally with histograms, from which we'll build an intuition for the Normal PDF; in the class for which these notes are being prepared, I'll have slides that walk you through how those work. Histograms are basically sample approximations of PDFs. On the X-axis, we have the possible-outcomes[^fn] for a variable; on the Y-axis, we have some kind of indication of the frequency of observations. So, any individual bar tells us the frequency of observations taking on a certain possible-value. For example, in the histogram for education below, about five percent of observations took on the value 11, meaning that five percent of the sample had 11 years of education. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^fn]: There is, unfortunately, no single-word term for \"possible outcomes\", which is a strange oversight. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Simple histogram for education](./figures/hist_educ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "PDFs are just the equivalent of a histogram when 1) we know about the true population distribution and 2) we have a continuous random variable. Recall that all actual sample data are discrete: we stop measuring the digits at a certain point (e.g., we measure height only to the tenth of an inch in some data-sets). But, in principle, height could be measured infinitely more-precisely with better and better microscopes, so it is a continuous random variable. But, it is rare to really know the PDF of a real-world variable; height happens to be approximately Normal, which is why I picked it as an example, but this is still only an approximation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Simple histogram for height](./figures/hist_height.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it turns out, quite impressively, that sample means are Normally-distributed across many samples: this is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In other words, if you had a population from which you could take an infinite number of samples (with replacement), the histogram of sample means would basically be indistinguishable from a smooth, Normal curve. We'll learn two useful techniques that use this fact in due time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the population is sufficiently large relative to the the size of the sample, each individual observation can be treated as independent of the others and taken from the same distribution (so long as they are drawn at random): they are \"independent, identically-distributed\" (IID) random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that each observation of the sample, before they are actually observed, is a random variable: when some researcher plans to sample 500 people and ask them their income, and she has not actually selected any individuals for inclusion, the income of the *i*th person, $Y_i$ is still a random variable. So, when we talk abstractly about the variance of a sample mean across many samples, we need to treat these sample means themselves as random variables. This is a major source of confusion early on, so remain *en garde* here: each actual observation in the sample is the *realization* of a random variable. It is often helpful to consider the analogy to an experiment in which we flip coins: the concept of \"the outcome of the 10th coin I flip\" is more-obviously a random variable for most people because it hasn't yet happened. While the person whose income I ultimately observe in the sample has already *obtained* that income, there is a point at which I don't know *which* person I'll observe, and thus that \"person's\" income is rather like the outcome of the as-yet-unflipped coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are after the variance of a sum of IID random variables (divided by the constant *n*).  While the extremely useful general formula for the variance of a sum of random variables is slightly complex (see appendix), it is not just extremely useful but extremely simple for independent random variables: it is just the sum of their variances. Let $\\overline{Y}$ represent the sample mean of a random variable comprised of *n* IID random variables $Y_1, Y_2, ... Y_n$; each variable comes from a population distribution with standard deviation $\\sigma_Y$, which we'll simply refer to using $\\sigma$ for simplicity.  \n",

This variable turns out to have a slightly different *t* distribution, and the exact calculation of degrees of freedom becomes somewhat involved (in fact, degrees of freedom no longer have to be integers, which is quite an interesting fact), but these are details that aren't really essential to an understanding of the basic point: we have a nearly-Normal sampling distribution for this difference in means.\n",

    "Fortunately, we have already learned the key rule for the standard error for a difference in means; if two random variables are independent, the variance of the variables' sum *or* difference is just the sum of the variances.

    "### The general formula for the variance of a sum of random variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let *Y* be the sum of random variables $Y_1, Y_2, ... Y_k$. Assume centered variables for the sake of step 5, where we will want to replace each variable's deviation from its mean with a single symbol to make the multinomial expansion easier. This can be, in principle, any symbol; it seems most natural to just use the variable itself, and we often assume centered variables anyways. Note that there is absolutely no difference if I had used, say, $\\Delta_{Y_j}$ to represent the deviation of the *j*th variable from its mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get an intuition for the correct algorithm for multinomial expansion, draw a picture of rectangle with both unique side lengths partitioned into $Y_1, Y_2, ... Y_k$. Then, find the area of the rectangle, which is logically equal, of course, to finding $(Y_1 + Y_2 + ... Y_k)^2$. The rectangle is now comprised of smaller rectangles with areas $(Y_1*Y_1), (Y_2*Y_1) ... (Y_k*Y_1)$ going down the first column, $(Y_1*Y_2), (Y_2*Y_2) ... (Y_k*Y_2)$ going down the second, etc. We can thus visualize this as operation as follows: write out $(Y_1 + Y_2 + ... Y_k)^2$ as $(Y_1 + Y_2 + ... Y_k)*(Y_1 + Y_2 + ... Y_k)$. Starting with the first (or second; it doesn't matter) set of parentheses, take each term, multiply it by every term in the second set of parentheses, then add them up, and then do this for each term in the first set. Then, add up all the summed terms. This corresponds to summing up all of the items in the variance-covariance matrix. It was too time-consuming for me to draw a picture of all of this in Markdown, but DeVellis (2003) is a good, unintimidating visual representation of this sort of proof (which is really useful in general in the context of statistics). \n",
